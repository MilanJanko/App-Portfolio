# Project  description

This is a simple web app to show my portfolio using Python.
I've  used streamlit as package  for  building and deploying the app.
### Main idea is to create a two column web page, in which I would add short description of my experience and recent projects.
#### Also, I would like to add my future hopes and something personal about myself.
