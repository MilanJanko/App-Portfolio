# Project  description

This is a simple web app to show my portfolio using Python.
I've  used streamlit as package  for  building and deploying the app.
### Main idea is to create a two column web page, in which I would add short description of my experience and recent projects.
#### Also, I would like to add my future hopes and something personal about myself.

Short app overview:
- I've added my recent projects in a two column web app, in which I arranged them all by title, short description, image and a link to my source code on GitHub.
- Then I've added navigation menu, which can be used to contact me if anyone wants to do so.
- You'll see that I've had to hide username and password in send_email.py file. It's an easy step - either you create environment variable(not supported on gmail from late 2022) or create another .py file in which you will store your credentials. And of course don't push them to Git.
